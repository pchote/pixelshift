# Pixelshift

A tool for calculating sub-pixel translational shifts between images and applying guide offsets to the Warwick one-metre telescope.

Implements the algorithms from [DONUTS](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PASP..125..548M), rewritten using code from [tsreduce](https://github.com/pchote/tsreduce/).
